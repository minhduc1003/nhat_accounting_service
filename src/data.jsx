    heading: "Preparing for Personal Income Tax finalisation for 2022",
    content:`<div class="uk-panel uk-margin uk-scrollspy-inview " id="article" uk-scrollspy-class="" style=""><p>Organisations and individual taxpayers in Vietnam should be aware of the guidance outlined by the Vietnam Ministry of Finance and General Department of Taxation when completing annual finalisations.</p>
    <p>In Vietnam, the tax system can be at times confusing and tedious, involving procedures and calculations that sometimes are complicated and hard to comprehend, particularly for expatriates and foreign individuals that have no technical knowledge on the Personal Income Tax rules and regulations that apply to salaries, wages and other income sources.</p>
    <p>In this article, we delineate the provisions and procedures for Personal Income Tax (PIT) finalisations in Vietnam, covering important circulars and decrees which regulate the implementation and reporting schedule.</p>
    <h2><strong>Guide and regulatory basis for 2022 PIT finalisation</strong></h2>
    <p>Process, forms of returns, and required documents are to follow regulations in Circular 80/2021/TT-BTC dated 29<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;September 2021, issued by the Ministry of Finance, and took effect from January 2022.</p>
    <p>Further regulations regarding PIT finalisation are also stipulated in Decree 126/2020/ND-CP dated 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;October 2020, provides guidance on the implementation of the Tax Administration Law 38/2019/QH14 dated 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June 2019.</p>
    <h2><strong>Individuals subject to direct (personal) finalisation</strong></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Tax residents receiving income from overseas entities</li>
    <li>Individuals receiving income from international organisations, embassies, consulates in Vietnam where PIT has not been withheld by these entities</li>
    <li>Individuals who participated in overseas share schemes with taxable income to declare</li>
    <li>Expatriates staying for less than 183 days in their first calendar year in Vietnam but more than 182 days in their first 12 consecutive months period counting from their arrival date, are subject to the first annual PIT finalisation covering the first 12 consecutive months.</li>
    <li>Expatriates terminating their working period in Vietnam are required to file annual PIT return before their departure.</li>
    <li>Individual having employment income and are subject to tax reduction due to disaster, fatal disease, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Notes: Tax non-residents are not required to submit PIT finalisation. Instead, they are subject to PIT at 20% tax rate upon each occurred income and the Vietnam entities paying income are responsible for withholding, declaring and paying tax on behalf of these non-residents. </em></p>
    <h2><strong>Income paying organisations subject to withholding finalisation</strong></h2>
    <p>Employers are required to file an annual PIT finalisation for any year incurring income paid to individual employees. The PIT finalisation of the company will consolidate the incomes, deductions and PIT of all staff in details and for the whole year. For the employees who authorise their employer to do PIT finalisation for them, their tax underpayment or overpayment will be calculated and processed through the entity; otherwise, they will need to process PIT self-finalisation with the income papers (Income Confirmation Letter and PIT withholding certificate) issued by their employer.</p>
    <p>If the individuals are transferred from an old organisation to a new one due to an event of merger, consolidation, spin-off or conversion, inter-transfer between two entities among a group company, the new organisation is responsible to finalise the PIT for the authorised employees on both the income received from the old and new organisation and recollect the PIT withholding certificate issued by the old organisation, if any.</p>
    <h2><strong>Individuals and organisations not required to complete PIT finalisations</strong></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Individual taxpayers whose additional PIT payable after finalisation is VND50,000 or below. The above PIT exempted amount is self-assessed by the individual. Neither the PIT finalisation applications or the exemption application are required to be submitted to the tax authority</li>
    <li>Individual taxpayers who have final PIT payable less than the PIT paid/withheld during the year and do not wish to apply for a refund or offset</li>
    <li>Organisations which did not pay income to employees are not required to submit the annual PIT finalisation</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Notes on types of incomes which are not subject to PIT finalisation</strong></h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Individual taxpayers having labour contracts with term of 3 months or more with one organisation and who concurrently earn irregular income from other organisation(s) with average monthly income not exceeding VND10 million on which 10% PIT has been withheld, can choose not to conduct the finalisation for such irregular income</li>
    <li>Individual taxpayers having life insurance premiums contributed by the employer on which 10% PIT on such income has been withheld are not required to finalise for this type of income</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Amendments for PIT finalisation dossiers and relevant circumstances</strong></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>If there is no change in the tax obligation, the taxpayer is not required to submit an amended tax return, however they are required to submit an explanation for supplementary declaration as well as relevant supporting documents</li>
    <li>If the annual PIT finalisation has not been submitted, the taxpayer is required to amend the relevant monthly/quarterly PIT returns and then consolidate the updated information into the annual PIT finalisation</li>
    <li>For individuals submitting the tax return directly to the tax authorities: only the amendment of annual PIT finalisation return is required</li>
    <li>For the income paying organisations: the amendments of both annual PIT finalisation return and relevant monthly/quarterly PIT returns are required</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Tax exemptions under Double Taxation Agreements (DTA)</strong></h2>
    <p>Expatriate employees are able to seek tax exemptions under double taxation agreements (DTA) to avoid double taxation, provided that an effective DTA signed between their home country and Vietnam is available.</p>
    <p>Prior to 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;January 2022, the tax office in Vietnam did not issue any DTA confirmation notice after a DTA application was submitted by the taxpayer. Circular 80/2021/TT-BTC (“Circular 80”) dated 29<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;September 2021, issued by the Ministry of Finance introduces new tax declaration forms which take effect from January 2022. These include notifications, conditions, and other relevant supporting documents:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Pursuant to Circular 80, an individual who is a resident of a contracting state to a tax treaty concluded with Vietnam and derives income from his/her employment in Vietnam, will pay PIT in Vietnam in accordance with Vietnam PIT regulations.</li>
    <li>If an individual concurrently and fully satisfies the following conditions, his/her remuneration from the employment in Vietnam shall be exempt from PIT in Vietnam:
    <ul>
    <li>Individual has a certificate of tax residence in his/her home country</li>
    <li>Individual is present in Vietnam for less than 183 days in a 12-month period starting or ending within the taxable year concerned</li>
    <li>Employer is not a resident of Vietnam, regardless of whether that remuneration is directly paid by the employer or through the employer’s representative</li>
    <li>The remuneration is not borne and paid by the Vietnam-based permanent establishment (PE) set up by the employer</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pursuant to Circular 80, tax authorities are required to issue a notice to the taxpayer claiming PIT exemption under a relevant DTA signed with Vietnam. The DTA confirmation notice shall be issued within 30 days (or 40 days in case of a tax audit) of submission of the DTA application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the fourth condition above should be carefully considered and justified, i.e., whether the foreign company which employs and pays income for the assigned foreign employees has a PE in Vietnam or not. The tax authorities are taking a strict approach in reviewing the DTA application and the related supporting documents before accepting the application and issuing the confirmation notice.</p>
    <h2><strong>Submission deadline for the annual PIT finalisation</strong></h2>
    <ul>
    <li>For income paying organizations, the deadline for submission of their annual PIT finalisation return is the last day of the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;month from the end of the calendar year or financial year (for 2022 PIT finalisation, the deadline is 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;March 2023)</li>
    <li>For individuals submitting their PIT return directly to the tax authorities, the deadline for submission of annual PIT finalisation return is the last day of the 4th month from the end of the calendar year. If the deadline falls on the National Holiday or weekend, the deadline is the next day (for 2022 PIT finalisation, the deadline is 4<sup>th</sup> May 2023).</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Official Letters released</h3>
<p>Official Letters are releases showing the Tax and other Authorities’ interpretation and application of Vietnam’s Taxation Laws, providing guidance to taxpayers in Vietnam.</p>
<h4>CIT incentives for software production projects English attachment</h4>
<p>On 1 March 2023, Hanoi Department of Tax released 2 Official Letters 8442/CTHN-TTHT and 8441/CTHN-TTHT on VAT and CIT incentives for software production activities and VAT incentives for software services.</p>
<p>Software production activities and software service providers are not subject to VAT as prescribed in Clause 21, Article 4 of Circular 219/2013/TT-BTC.</p>
<p>However, for CIT, only software production activities are eligible for CIT incentives (i.e., income from software services is not eligible for CIT incentives).</p>
<p>In particular, where the company performs a project meeting the requirements of new projects as regulated and does business in the sector of software manufacturing according to the law, CIT incentives will be determined as below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incentives on tax rates: tax rate at 10% in a period of 15 years. The period of application of the preferential tax rate is calculated continuously from the first year the enterprise has revenue from the new investment project entitled to tax incentives.</li>
<li>Incentives on tax exemption and reduction: CIT exemption for 4 years and 50% reduction of payable tax for the next 9 years.<br>
The tax exemption and reduction period is calculated continuously from the first year the enterprise earns taxable income from an investment project entitled to tax incentives. In case the company has no taxable income in the first 3 years from the first year of revenue generated from the new investment project, the tax exemption and reduction period is calculated from the 4th year that the new investment project generates revenue.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Invoice when returning goods</h4>
<p>On 28 February 2023, Hanoi Department of Taxation released Official Letter 8202/CTHN-TTHT guiding on requirements of issuing invoices when a company returns goods to the provider.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of Article 4 of Decree 123/2020/ND-CP, when a company returns purchased goods to the providers, the enterprise must also issue an invoice. The VAT rate on the return invoice is recorded according to the tax rate of the goods stated on the purchase invoice.</p>
<p>Where the company has a commercial discount on the quantity and sales, the discount amount of the sold goods will be adjusted on the invoice of the last purchase or the next period. Where the discount amount is made at the end of the sales discount program (period), an adjustment invoice will be issued according to the provisions of Article 19 of Decree 123/2020/ND-CP.</p>
<p>Where the enterprise receives an amount to provide support services for product display, it must declare and pay VAT according to the provisions of Article 15 of Circular 219/2013/TT-BTC. The time to issue invoices and determine VAT is the time to complete the service provision. Where the enterprise issues invoices after 31 December 2022, they are no longer eligible to apply the VAT reduction policy according to Decree 15/2022/ND-CP.</p>

    heading:"Improving Institutions and the Business Environment",
    content:`<div class="col-xs-12 tinymce-page__text">
                        
    <p>Whilst much has been spoken in the past on the need to improve institutions and the business environment, in order to attract and retain foreign direct investment, progress has been slow. However, it would seem that the Government is now paying more attention to this in the light of a recent report<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>, which highlighted “the number of projects with advanced and modern technology and European technology only accounted for approx. 5%...”</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>FDI enterprises currently account for 55% of industrial production and 75% of exports<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a> but will relatively low levels of investment in modern and efficient technology the spillover effect on productivity and efficiency have not been high. Vietnam has also suffered because of the constant relatively high increases in the minimum wage with a lower percentage increase in productivity although this has started to change in recent years.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The report also highlighted that the limitations in attracting advanced technology were primarily caused by the fact that institutions and policies on FDI had not kept pace with development requirements. The EU Vietnam FTA was one of the first if not the first FTA to incorporate the requirements for Institutional reform and measures to level the playing field and already we have seen confidence shown by European investors such as Leggo, Pandora and Ecco who have all made significant investment commitments using advanced technology. However, it is early days and other companies will be eagerly watching for changes and improvements in both the institutions and FDI policies.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Changes recommended by VAFIE include strengthening the state management of FDI from the stage of project promotion through the process to inspection and supervision of implementation<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>. Also under discussion is a set of evaluation criteria including specific economic, technological, and social indicators serving as a basis for foreign investors to self score prior to project screening by local authorities before issuing investment licenses.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To support these suggestions and recommendations is the continuing drive for transparency and governance and the recent announcement of the setting up of provincial Steering Committees on Anti-corruption</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>Of course the devil as always is in the detail but it is encouraging that these discussions are taking place openly with Government.</p>

    content:`<div class="col-xs-12 tinymce-page__text">
                        
    <p style="text-align: left;">To enhance the enterprises’ compliance of the preparation and submission of CFR, the General Department of Customs issued Official Letter No. 2505/TCHQ-GSQL ("Official Letter 2505") proposing an inspection plan for the group of enterprises engaged in Processing, Manufacturing, Exporting activities and Export Processing Enterprises on last 27 June 2022. Based on the assigned plan, the Local Customs Departments are required to complete the inspection of FY2021 CFR for the group of enterprises mentioned above before the deadline of submission the FY2022 CFR.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Under the prevailing regulations, CFR is required to prepare and submit to the Customs Authorities within 90 days after the fiscal year-end. In addition, it is allowed to adjust within the next 60 days and before the time the Customs Authority issues the inspection decision.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">In our experience, due to the needs of management, most large enterprises operate and perform specific works through number of particular departments, i.e. Finance, Accounting, and Import Export/Shipping departments, leading to potential discrepancies between the declared data on the customs systems and the internal accounting data in the enterprises. In most cases, these discrepancies are not actively detected, analyzed and explained to the Customs Authority during the inspection of the CFR. Accordingly, it will lead to a high risk of incurring additional tax exposures and being collected at the import and export stages.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">To well-prepare for future inspections and strengthen the internal compliance processes, it is highly recommended the enterprises to implement internal reviews to ensure that CFR is prepared and submitted in compliance with current regulations as well as minimize unnecessary errors leading to the risk of incurring additional tax obligations at the import and export stages as mentioned above.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Please get in touch with our customs experts of Grant Thornton Vietnam for in-depth advice if you have any inquiries during the implementation of the CFR’s preparation and submission or other compliance issues related to import and export tax and customs procedures.</p>

In which, the regulation of adjustments to procedures for registration of dependents from 1 January 2023 is notable, with the following points:</p>

    <h3>A Request from the Government to amend Decree 31/2022/ND-CP providing 2% interest rate support for businesses</h3>
    <p>Previously, the Government of Vietnam issued Decree 31/2022/ND-CP on 20 May 2022 regarding interest rate subsidies from the state budget for loans to enterprises, cooperatives, and household businesses. According to the Decree, the interest rate subsidy for enterprises, cooperatives, and household businesses is 2% per year on the loan balance and loan interest subsidy terms in the prescribed periods. The term for subsidising loan interest rate starts from the date of disbursement of a loan to the date on which the borrower pays off the principal in conformity with the announced funding resource for providing the interest subsidy and must not extend past 31 December 2023.</p>
    <p>However, the decree still has matters which remain unclear and which provides obstacles to implementation. Therefore, at the regular government meeting and through Resolution 10/NQ-CP issued on 3 February 2023, the Government requested the State Bank to urgently submit a Decree amending Decree 31 in February 2023 to remove obstacles and promote disbursement of the 2% interest rate support package through the system of commercial banks.</p>
